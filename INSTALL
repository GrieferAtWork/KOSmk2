Step #1:
Download, patch and build deemon, binutil, gcc and mtools for use with KOS.
	$ bash configure

Step #2:
Build/run KOS
	$ deemon ${PREFIX}/magic.dee
NOTE: Unless already in-PATH, 'configure' will have created a local installation of
      deemon that can be accessed via a symbolic link found in '/binutils/bin/deemon':
	$ binutils/bin/deemon ${PREFIX}/magic.dee


Once done, you may run "shell.sh" to enter an interactive shell with
gcc and friends re-mapped to the ones you've created in "binutils/bin"
You may also run single commands by prefixing them with "shell.sh"

You can now run KOS. - But that's no fun.
To get a proper shell, look at "apps/busybox-readme"
